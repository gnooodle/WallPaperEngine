# WallPaperEngine
A, so far, simple HolyC Wallpaper engine for TempleOS

Probably soon to come:
* Options for colors White, Brown, and Yellow (not added yet because I was lazy due to an interference issue)

Maybe? soon(not) to come:
* Option to draw image(s) to use for Wallpaper decoration, in addition to the main color change
* Interactive menu, lacking the need for typing options (might need to take a whole different approach)

This repo is here simply for reference, I may create/find a suitable a way to mount the project to Temple in the future
